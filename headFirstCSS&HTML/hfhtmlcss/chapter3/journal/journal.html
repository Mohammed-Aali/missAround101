<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed 
through some interesting places on the way:</p>

<h2>January 20, 2023</h2>
<p>I saw some <em>Burma Shave</em> style signs on the side of the road today:</p>

<blockquote>
Passing cars,<br> when you can't see,<br> May get you,<br> A glimpse,<br> Of eternity. 
</blockquote> 

<p>I definitely won't be passing any cars

<p>My first day of the trip! I can't belive I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:

<ul>
  <li>cell phone</li>
  <li>iPod</li>
  <li>digital camera</li>
  <li>and a protien bar</li>
</ul>

Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,<q> A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step</q>
