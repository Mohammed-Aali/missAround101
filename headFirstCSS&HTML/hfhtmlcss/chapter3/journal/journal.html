<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>

<blockquote>
Passing cars, when you can't see, May get you glimpse, Of eternity. 
</blockquote> 

<p>I definitely won't be passing any cars

<p>My first day of the trip! I can't belive I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod, digital camera, and a protien bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,<q> A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step</q></p>
